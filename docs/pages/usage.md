# Usage

chess-library is a single header library. Thus to use it in your project just copy the header file `chess.hpp` into your project  
and include in the necessary files.

The entire library is behind the `chess` namespace so for easy usage just say

```cpp
using namespace chess;
```

**Example**

```cpp
#include "chess.hpp"

using namespace chess;

```
